"""
Fixed gold evaluation set for DPDP moderation regression testing.

Run after every retrain to ensure no regressions:
  python3 gold_eval.py
  python3 gold_eval.py --verbose      # show per-layer reasons
  python3 gold_eval.py --strict       # exit 1 if any test fails (CI mode)
  python3 gold_eval.py --buckets      # show per-scenario breakdown

This set is NEVER used in training — it is the held-out truth.
Add new entries here whenever you discover a new FP or FN, then keep it forever.
