"""
Synthetic dataset generator for DPDP Act violation classification.
Produces 500-1500 balanced samples across 8 intent classes with
adversarial paraphrases and jailbreak variations.

Label taxonomy
--------------
safe              — benign queries, legal education, compliance engineering
personal_data     — direct PII lookup/harvest requests
financial_data    — financial record access violations
health_data       — medical/health data access violations
profiling         — building sensitive attribute profiles from behavioural data
surveillance      — real-time tracking, interception, covert monitoring
criminal_misuse   — active fraud, identity theft, data breach monetisation,
                    phishing, SIM swap — requires law enforcement response
compliance_abuse  — DPDP/GDPR policy violations framed as business decisions:
                    consent bypass, purpose creep, dark patterns, shadow
                    collection, overbroad access — requires regulatory/DPO response

Keeping criminal_misuse and compliance_abuse separate improves explainability:
the audit log can say "blocked: criminal intent" vs "blocked: compliance violation"
and downstream policy responses can differ (auto-block vs HUMAN_REVIEW).
